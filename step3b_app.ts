import a from "./first.js";//In the import use .js file extension instead of just using "./second":
import {b, c as d} from "./second.js";

console.log(a + b + d);


//Using the .js file extension when importing a module, like this: import "./second.js", has a few benefits:

//1. Explicitness: It clearly indicates that you're importing a JavaScript file, making your code more readable and self-explanatory.

//2. Avoids confusion: Without the .js extension, it may be unclear whether you're importing a JavaScript file or a module with a default export. Using the extension avoids this confusion.

//3. Compatibility: Some build tools or plugins might require the .js extension to properly resolve imports. Using the extension ensures compatibility with these tools.

// //4. Consistency: Including the .js extension maintains consistency with other import statements that explicitly specify the file extension (e.g., import "./styles.css").

// However, it's worth noting that in modern JavaScript and TypeScript, the .js extension is often optional, and the compiler or build tool can usually resolve the import without it. So, while using the extension has benefits, it's not always strictly necessary.
