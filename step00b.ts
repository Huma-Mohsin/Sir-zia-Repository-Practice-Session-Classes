console.log(message);
    
//A syntax error is an error that occurs when the code written in a programming language (in this case, TypeScript) violates the language's rules and syntax. It's like a grammatical error in a sentence.

// TypeScript has its own set of rules that define how code should be written, including things like:

// - How to declare variables and functions
// - How to use keywords and symbols
// - How to structure code blocks and statements

// When you write code that doesn't follow these rules, the TypeScript compiler will throw a syntax error. This error will usually include a message that indicates what's wrong with the code and where the error occurred.
