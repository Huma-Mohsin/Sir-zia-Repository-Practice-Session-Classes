// Array is a collection of different elements of different data types.
// In JavaScript, an array is both a data structure and a type.
//Data Structure:
//An array is a data structure that allows you to store and manipulate a collection of elements. It's a way to organize and store data in a linear sequence, making it easy to access and modify the elements.
//Type:
//In JavaScript, an array is also a type, specifically an object type. Yes, you read that right - an array is an object! This means that an array has properties and methods, just like objects do. The Array constructor creates an array object, and you can use the typeof operator to check its type:
var arr1 = [];
console.log(typeof arr1); // returns "object"
